   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS. CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1. Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights." Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>Default passwords are the passwords that ship with computers, applications, routers, and other equipment. Default passwords are a very common way for computer systems, devices, and applications to be hacked. Lists of default passwords for operating systems, applications, and devices are readily available on the internet for anyone to download and try on enterprise systems. Therefore, they need to be changed from the defaults to something that is not easily guessable.
               <p>Default passwords can be easily guessed by individuals external to an organization, which can result in the theft of sensitive enterprise data. For example, if the password for a wireless router is guessed, an attacker will be able to add and remove network devices, which will allow them to read sensitive enterprise information. To be able to guess a router’s default password, it’s often sufficient to identify the make and model. Attacks may be able to figure this out by physically seeing the device, or remotely based on a router’s SSID or MAC address. Cheatsheets are also available online with the default passwords for wireless routers common to small and home offices. If a password for an application or utility is guessed, the offending party will be able to access the information contained by that program.</p>

               <xhtml:p>On the surface, logging may appear to be a boring task, but it’s a critical cybersecurity control to have in place. Once a security breach occurs, reviewing logs is often the primary way that computer incident responders identify who did what, and when they did it. Log files allow incident responders to track what happened on individual systems, but also the entire network. Logs can also be helpful to an enterprise when performing general maintenance activities to understand the current status of computer systems and networks, and be notified to take action if there’s a problem. But this visibility is not always on by default and often must be manually enabled. 
                  <p>Logging doesn’t stop threats from happening. Instead logs help to provide tamper detection, which means if an unauthorized event happens to one of your computer systems or the data stored there, you’ll be able to know that something was changed.</p>

            <xhtml:p>Anti-malware, sometimes referred to as anti-virus, is a well-known product of security technology. Anti-malware suites work by constantly monitoring all of the running applications on a system, and alerting the user and/or enterprise administrator if a malicious program or other suspicious activity is detected. A list of suspicious applications and actions that the security technology looks for is created and kept up-to-date by the anti-malware company. The company regularly delivers updates to the suspicious applications and actions list on a regular basis, and these updates are called signatures. If signatures are not downloaded and installed on a regular basis, machines may be vulnerable to the most recent attacks. Because it’s easy to forget, antivirus updates should be set to automatically download and install on each and every computer in an enterprise.
               <p>Malware is software specifically designed to attack computer systems, devices, and data. Malware is the catch-all term for spyware, adware, and all the other types of malicious software developed to attack computers and steal information. Malware is quick to change and hard to keep track of, and can enter through any number of points like email attachments, smart phones, web pages, cloud services, and USB drives. Modern malware can be quite benign and just slow a computer system down, or it can be much more pernicious, stealing passwords and company data or holding that company data for ransom.</p>

            <xhtml:p>A backup is a duplicate of a computer system’s data. If an attacker breaches a network or computer system, their first step will often be to change system configurations to ensure access to the attacker is permanently available. Additionally automated malware infections will often delete or prevent an organization’s valid access to data. Attackers will sometimes make subtle alterations to data that can jeopardize an organization’s effectiveness at a later date. It’s also common for computer systems to fail and simply stop working when attacked. This can be especially true of backend information systems that remain out of sight from customers. These systems may simply grow old and need to be replaced. Other accidents can happen like fires and floods. Systems fail and a plan needs to be in place to make sure that a business can recover from whatever incident occurs. Automated backups taken on a regular basis are a primary part of an enterprise disaster recovery plan.

            <xhtml:p>A backup is a duplicate of a computer system’s data, but different types and degrees of backups exist. A backup is commonly viewed as a small collection of a system’s overall data. Often times a few important folders containing photos, receipts, contracts, or tax information are stored elsewhere. This information may be stored on another computer system, external hard drive, removable media, or cloud service. This strategy is insufficient for protecting an organization. Flavors of backups include incremental, differential, or complete. A complete system image is a snapshot of all data and settings on a system.
               <p>If a system is breached by an attacker, infected with malware, or involved in an accident (e.g., fire, flood), it often takes a long time to bring a system or network back online. This would include reinstalling and configuring all of the enterprise applications used for business tasks. Complete system backups rectify this issue by backing up not just important folders, but by backing up the entire computer, which can be pushed to new systems. Although this approach is a more complex solution, it makes recovery from a disaster or computer incident much quicker and enables you to get your business operational again.

            <xhtml:p>Backups can help an enterprise recover from a variety of disaster situations, be they the cause of malicious actors or accidents. Yet backups can be physically and digitally targeted by attackers looking to hurt an enterprise. Backups that are connected to a network can be altered or deleted by malware, and physical backup drives can be stolen or suffer fires, floods, and other natural disasters. Backups need to be protected from these threats in order to be useful when the time comes. Digital mitigations include authenticating users before access and encrypting backups. Physical mitigations include keeping backup drives locked away from thieves, and also outside of the same fire zone. This means that if a fire or flood were to strike an organization’s physical location, the backups would not be affected. This is sometimes accomplished by using third-party backup services to store data offsite. These backups need to be protected as well.
               <p>There are two primary groups of threats to backups: digital and physical. Digital threats include local and remote attempts to access backups without being properly authenticated.

Therefore, an organization’s sensitive email, with proprietary secrets, financials, and more, is stored on a device that an employee could easily misplace or have stolen. One of the best ways to help protect against these failures is to encrypt a company’s information while on the device.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>The Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, is an algorithm used for cryptographic encryption of information standardized by the United States Government in 2001. It is considered a modern, strong cipher that has withstood attempts to break it for nearly two decades. This purpose of this Sub-Control is to make sure that an organization’s wireless traffic is strongly encrypted. AES is built into most wireless access points, or wireless routers, that can be bought at major electronics stores. AES is utilized with Wireless Protected Access version 2, or WPA2. Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or Wireless Protected Access (WPA) version 1 have known weaknesses that can allow an attacker to decrypt the traffic, so their use does not meet this Sub-Control, as AES will not be the algorithm used to encrypt wireless information. It is easier for an attacker to listen to wireless communications than wired communications. By properly setting up AES, anyone listening, or sniffing, the wireless network will not be able to understand the data transmitted on the network.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>An accurate and up-to-date inventory of computer systems within a network is often the first step in securing an enterprise. This list of information systems is known as a hardware asset inventory. Having a definitive list of what hardware is supposed to be part of a network enables comparison against the list of systems that are actually in place. This allows for the identification of unauthorized devices that should not be connected. A hardware asset inventory also helps define what an organization needs to protect. 
               <p>An asset inventory often extends beyond what is solely connected to the network. Many organizations utilize older smartphones, laptops, networking gear, and other technology that may not be connected, or even powered on, yet might still contain sensitive information if the data is exfiltrated outside of the network. In addition to physical systems, many enterprises use third-party services for website hosting or email that are hosted in the cloud. Accordingly, any third-party services and cloud platforms should be included in the asset inventory. Examples of what to track include: <ul> <li>General computer workstations, laptops, phones, tablets, servers, and network devices</li> <li>Physical systems and devices operated or possibly owned by another organization that are connected to your network (e.g., Point of Sale devices), and</li> <li>Systems used by an organization that are cloud-hosted.</li></ul></p>

            <xhtml:p>An accurate and up-to-date inventory of all company software is nearly as important as tracking the hardware inventory (as mentioned in Sub-Control 1.4). By tracking the software being used on organizational assets, organizations can work to ensure that only authorized software is actually installed. Maintaining an authorized software inventory provides the capability to identify the software that is not allowed to be installed. Unauthorized software may include older versions of previously authorized software applications, or software installed by an employee, unbeknownst to the enterprise (sometimes referred to as shadow IT). Unauthorized software also includes any malware or code installed by an attacker with system access. Understanding the software installed on a system helps organizations to define their software attack surface, and allow for a plan to be devised to remove unauthorized software.  
               <p>Software should be tracked for all enterprise systems and devices, even if they do not have network access. An old, unpatched application running on a non-networked system may be connected at some point in the future.

In addition to physical systems, some companies may rely upon cloud infrastructure for email and data storage. Virtualized systems are another asset type that can contain sensitive enterprise data.

            <xhtml:p>Accounts on a computer system can have different types of privileges. The accounts with the highest levels of access and privileges are called administrative accounts. Other terms for this account include admin, superuser, or root accounts. These accounts grant access to all of a computer system’s data and functionality, thus protecting these accounts is of the utmost importance. If they are abused or taken advantage of, they can be used to compromise an entire system and the computers connected to them. For example, if you are using an administrative account to browse the web, and accidentally download malware, the malware will be able to run on a computer with the highest levels of access.
               <p>Yet administrative accounts are needed for certain important tasks. Examples include installing new programs, updating the operating system, or adding new users. This Sub-Control states that administrative tasks need to be accomplished with a separate account dedicated to administrative tasks. Normal accounts should be used for everyday business tasks, like using a browser to perform market research or using accounting software. If vulnerabilities in your operating system are exploited, they often have a much lesser impact if they are exploited within the realm of a normal account.</p>
               <p>If someone is able to obtain administrative access on a computer system, they essentially have the keys to the kingdom. They will be able to steal passwords stored on the computer, which may be used in other computer systems or applications within a network.

This means that they are on the front line of an organization’s IT infrastructure, being exposed to a variety of digital threats on a daily basis. In fact, browsers and email clients are likely the most exposed applications within an enterprise. Because of this it’s important to keep all browsers and email systems up-to-date.

Sometimes versions of browsers are no longer supported, and an entirely new browser or email client will need to be installed. 
               <p>When an email client or browser is attacked there can be a number of bad outcomes. One example is that a browser extension can be installed which is an extra program that gets put into your browser. These can be extremely helpful and provide great benefits such as allowing teleconferencing or managing passwords. Unfortunately, if a malicious programmer is able to get one of these installed into your browser, they can often severely invade your privacy by watching all of your web activity and potentially reading information that would normally be protected (e.g., encrypted).</p>

            <xhtml:p>While there are a lot of technical details relating to Domain Name Service (DNS), the important details are relatively simple. Think of DNS as a phonebook for websites which translates a human understandable domain such as (www.cisecurity.org) to a series of numbers that a computer can understand. These numbers are IP addresses like (93.184.215.125). Therefore, when a computer wants to connect to cisecurity.org, it uses DNS to look up where it can find cisecurity.org, much like how a phone book would be used to search a person’s name to get their phone number. All of this happens transparently in the background when requesting a webpage, leaving individuals to solely need to remember the domain name instead of the having to remember complex numbers.
               <p>This Sub-Control will help to prevent enterprise infrastructure from connecting to known malicious servers that may be controlling, hosting or distributing malware or trying to collect sensitive information. As you can imagine, DNS is a key service for allowing the internet to function, good or bad. Many bad actors will host a malicious domain like “evil.com” where they can do any number of things, like trick users into giving sensitive information (phishing) or control already infected systems. By using a DNS filtering service, you’re essentially pointing your computer to a filtered phonebook that won’t provide you the phone number to any known bad domains, thereby protecting you from getting infected or communicating with that malicious system.</p>

If access to the data is never restored, it is considered destructive malware.
               <p>Besides user education and antivirus software, one of the best defenses against ransomware is backing up data to another system before access is lost. But backups alone won’t completely prevent this malware from accomplishing its goals. Typical backups may be connected to another system or network, meaning backup data can still be attacked. Therefore, regular backups should be stored in an unconnected manner.</p>

            <xhtml:p>Network boundaries define how data flows and traverses an enterprise network. Wired and wireless boundaries will exist, alongside logical boundaries. Logical boundaries sometimes include subnetworks (e.g., subnets) or virtual local area networks (vLANs). Generally, information cannot flow from one subnet to another without a networking device such as a firewall or router acting as a gatekeeper for access. This helps to establish trust boundaries between network segments. Therefore, a survey should be performed to understand where trusted networks end and untrusted ones begin.
               <p>Understanding network boundaries can be a challenging task in a network that has been growing organically for some time. The simplest example of a network boundary is the demarcation between a wireless and wired network. Another commonly seen example of a network boundary is between the external network (typically the internet), and the internal intranet. An intranet generally isn’t accessible from outside of the trust boundary. Sometimes specific subnets will not be able to communicate with others. This is sometimes intentional for security reasons. Finally, another important boundary to keep in mind is when a single organization has multiple physical locations. Often IT will work to logically connect all of their physical locations together.</p> 
               <p>Specifically noting which networks are within your trust boundary, and then regularly checking them helps to prevent from accidentally trusting an untrustworthy device or network component. For instance, public users such as customers should not be granted access to the intranet, which often contains sensitive enterprise information.</p>

            <xhtml:p>The overarching CIS Control 12 details precautions that should be taken for boundary defense.  Boundary defense is the notion of establishing and protecting a perimeter around an organization’s externally facing networking equipment. The enterprise boundary is a foundation of a defensive strategy for both internal and external threats. Sub-Control 9.4 focuses on controlling communication from a typical enterprise workstation, whereas Sub-Control 12.4 manages how communication is controlled on networking devices, such as firewalls. In order to accomplish this, the firewall configuration and ruleset in use should be carefully reviewed, monitored, and curated. If an enterprise grade firewall is not in use, many of the dual-use modems / wireless access points from the ISP will often have a firewall built into the system which can be enabled.   
               <p>A large majority of attacks launched against an organization will attempt to enter networks through a firewall. Firewalls often act the default entry point into a network and can deny communication over certain ports. Because of this they are under nearly constant attack and must be configured properly to protect the organization's assets sitting behind them. A firewall is typically envisioned to protect against basic attacks using a variety of protocols such as HTTP, FPT, and NTP.</p>

            <xhtml:p>Social engineering attacks are one of the more common and successful types of attacks. This is because they prey upon human tendencies and emotions. Even if not always successful, any successfully social engineering attack can have devastating impacts on an organization. While these types of attacks are often preventable, they are getting more and more sophisticated and harder to spot. This is why it is important for employees to know what to look for and how to spot suspicious activity in their email, over the phone, and even in person.
               <p>The goal of social engineering is to get a user to do something that the attacker wants, such as disclose information or run a malicious program. Social engineering attacks include phishing, spear phishing, vishing, pretexting, baiting, tailgating, and quid pro quo. Phishing is the most common type of social engineering attack. The attacker recreates the website or support portal of a renowned company and sends the link to targets via emails or social media platforms. The other person, completely unknown to the real attacker, ends up compromising personal information and even credit card details. Another form of phishing will trick the user to navigating to a website that downloads malicious software.</p>

            <xhtml:p>Data classification provides one of the most basic ways for organizations to determine and assign relative values to the data they possess. The process of data classification allows organizations to categorize their stored data by sensitivity and business impact in order to determine the risks associated with the data. After the process is completed, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect its value to them instead of treating all data the same way. Data classification is a conscious, thoughtful approach that enables organizations to realize optimizations that might not be possible when all data is assigned the same value.
               <p>Improperly handling sensitive data can lead to unintentional sensitive data exposure, such as placing trade secrets on a cloud platform that doesn’t require authentication for data access. Improper data handling can also make it easier for attackers to access enterprise data in an unauthorized manner. Therefore, clearly marked and labeled data, alongside the appropriate policies for handling sensitive data, can help employees understand and properly handle sensitive information.</p>

One of the key details required in many state laws is information on how the breach occurred, how many people were impacted, and what was done to remedy the attack. Reducing the impact and understanding the details of the breach are both much more achievable with earlier detection and response. Employees are key to this early detection.

When a data breach occurs, it can feel like multiple extremely important events are all taking place at the same time.
