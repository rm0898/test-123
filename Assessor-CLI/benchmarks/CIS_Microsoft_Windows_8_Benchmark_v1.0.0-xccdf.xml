   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

               <title xml:lang="en">Set 'Account lockout threshold' to '5 invalid logon
                  attempt(s)'</title>
               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines the number of failed logon
                  attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can lock themselves out of an
                  account by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by
                  changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The
                  computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the
                  user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock
                  occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout
                  threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                  logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature. Because it is possible
                  for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by
                  triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should
                  determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the
                  risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy
                  setting. - Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that
                  accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that
                  attempts to lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk
                  calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts
                  accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack.
                  The following defenses should also be considered: - A password policy that forces
                  all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters. - A robust
                  auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account
                  lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should
                  monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies
                  that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt. The second
                  option is: - Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that
                  provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks
                  out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will
                  prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                  prevent a DoS attack. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">5 invalid logon
                     attempt(s)</span>.</description>
               <rationale xml:lang="en">Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions
                  of password combinations for any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks
                  can be almost eliminated if you limit the number of failed logons that can be
                  performed. However, a DoS attack could be performed on a domain that has an
                  account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a
                  series of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of
                  attempts is greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able
                  to lock out every account.</rationale>

                        calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number of calls to the
                        help desk in many organizations. If you enforce this setting an attacker
                        could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed
                        logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account
                        Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes. If you
                        configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an
                        attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack
                        might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.</p>

                  that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is
                  enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: - Not contain the
                  user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive
                  characters - Be at least six characters in length - Contain characters from three
                  of the following four categories: - English uppercase characters (A through Z) -
                  English lowercase characters (a through z) - Base 10 digits (0 through 9) -
                  Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) - A catch-all category of any
                  Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This
                  fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password
                  increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all
                  lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion)
                  possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many
                  password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A
                  seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A
                  seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627
                  combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible
                  combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts
                  per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,
                  these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and
                  other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password
                  settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended

                        help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not
                        be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However,
                        all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with
                        minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent security
                        requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that
                        allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example,
                        a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters.
                        (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key
                        and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might
                        also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does
                        not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key
                        character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password.
                        However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users
                        and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could
                        consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters
                        in the 01280159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent
                        standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to
                        the password.)</p>

                     they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their

                  Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include: 4960: IPsec
                  dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem
                  persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in
                  transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer
                  are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate
                  interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. 4961: IPsec dropped an
                  inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could
                  indicate a replay attack against this computer. 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound
                  packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence
                  number to ensure it was not a replay. 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text
                  packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer
                  changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a
                  spoofing attack attempt. 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with
                  an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by
                  malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist,
                  verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those
                  received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems
                  with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded,
                  then these events can be ignored. 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
                  5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
                  Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
                  computer to potential security risks. 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the
                  complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential
                  security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection
                  provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to
                  diagnose the problem. 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec
                  Services could not be started. 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical
                  failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the
                  computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential
                  security risks. 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a
                  plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk
                  because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the
                  applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the

                  In domain environments, most of the Account Logon events occur in the Security log
                  of the domain controllers that are authoritative for the domain accounts. However,
                  these events can occur on other computers in the organization when local accounts
                  are used to log on. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article Description of

               <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports when registry objects are
                  accessed. Only registry objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated, and
                  only when they are accessed in a manner matching their SACL. By itself, this
                  policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines whether to
                  audit the event of a user who accesses a registry object that has a specified
                  system access control list (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place. A
                  SACL is comprised of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces
                  of information: - The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be audited.
                  - The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask. - A flag to
                  indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
                  If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is
                  generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified
                  SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated
                  each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                  SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they
                  configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data
                  auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced,
                  because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable
                  files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or
                  changed. Events for this subcategory include: 4657 : A registry value was
                  modified. 5039: A registry key was virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft

                  itself, this policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines
                  whether to audit the event of a user who accesses a file share object that has a
                  specified system access control list (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take
                  place. A SACL is comprised of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains
                  three pieces of information: - The security principal (user, computer, or group)
                  to be audited. - The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask. -
                  A flag to indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access
                  events, or both. If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an
                  audit entry is generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object

                  entry is generated each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object
                  with a specified SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want
                  enabled when they configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write
                  and Append Data auditing setting on executable files to track when they are
                  changed or replaced, because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically
                  target executable files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive
                  documents are accessed or changed. Events for this subcategory include: 5140: A
                  network share object was accessed. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article

               <description xml:lang="en">This subcategory reports when file system objects are
                  accessed. Only file system objects with SACLs cause audit events to be generated,
                  and only when they are accessed in a manner matching their SACL. By itself, this
                  policy setting will not cause auditing of any events. It determines whether to
                  audit the event of a user who accesses a file system object that has a specified
                  system access control list (SACL), effectively enabling auditing to take place. A
                  SACL is comprised of access control entries (ACEs). Each ACE contains three pieces
                  of information: - The security principal (user, computer, or group) to be audited.
                  - The specific access type to be audited, called an access mask. - A flag to
                  indicate whether to audit failed access events, successful access events, or both.
                  If you configure the Audit object access setting to Success, an audit entry is
                  generated each time that a user successfully accesses an object with a specified
                  SACL. If you configure this policy setting to Failure, an audit entry is generated
                  each time that a user fails in an attempt to access an object with a specified
                  SACL. Organizations should define only the actions they want enabled when they
                  configure SACLs. For example, you might want to enable the Write and Append Data
                  auditing setting on executable files to track when they are changed or replaced,
                  because computer viruses, worms, and Trojan horses typically target executable
                  files. Similarly, you might want to track when sensitive documents are accessed or
                  changed. Events for this subcategory include: 4664: An attempt was made to create
                  a hard link. 4985: The state of a transaction has changed. 5051: A file was
                  virtualized. Refer to the Microsoft Knowledgebase article Description of security

                        daunting management challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic

                        to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier

                        SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you

                     <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Blank passwords are a serious threat to
                        computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy
                        and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active
                        Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters.
                        However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your
                        domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank
                        passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create
                        one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the
                        domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone
                        who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to
                        log on.</p>

                        the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this

                        auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled,
                        the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any

                        disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear
                        to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash
                        malicious code on your computer network. To reduce the possibility of such
                        an event, only administrators should be allowed to install printer drivers.
                        However, because laptops are mobile devices, laptop users may occasionally
                        need to install a printer driver from a remote source to continue their
                        work. Therefore, this policy setting should be disabled for laptop users,
                        but always enabled for desktop users. Configure this setting in a manner
                        that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your
                        organization.</p>

                        do so on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may
                        unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user
                        could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to
                        damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software

                     <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting determines the
                        number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can
                        lock themselves out of the computer by mistyping their password or by
                        remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer
                        while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect
                        password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the
                        password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid
                        accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold to
                        a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon
                        attempts, which disables the machine lockout feature. There are two options
                        to consider for this policy setting.</p>
                     <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                        <li>Configure the value for Machine lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that
                           accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will reduce help desk
                           calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their
                           accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a
                           brute force attack. The following defenses should also be
                           considered:</li>
                        <li>A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made
                           up of 8 or more characters.</li>
                        <li>A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a
                           series of account lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the
                           auditing solution should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon
                           failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on the account at
                           the time of the logon attempt.</li>
                        <li>The second option is:</li>
                        <li>Configure the value for Machine lockout threshold to a value that
                           provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times,
                           but locks out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This
                           configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help
                           desk calls.</li>

                           <p>Because vulnerabilities can exist when this value is configured as
                              well as when it is not configured, two distinct countermeasures are
                              defined. Any organization should weigh the choice between the two
                              based on their identified threats and the risks that they want to
                              mitigate. The two countermeasure options are:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Configure the Machine Lockout Threshold setting to 0. This
                                 configuration ensures that accounts will not be locked out, and
                                 also helps reduce help desk calls because users cannot accidentally
                                 lock themselves out of their accounts. Because it will not prevent
                                 a brute force attack, this configuration should only be chosen if
                                 both of the following criteria are explicitly met:</li>
                              <li>The password policy requires all users to have complex passwords
                                 of 8 or more characters.</li>
                              <li>A robust audit mechanism is in place to alert administrators when
                                 a series of failed logons occur in the environment.</li>
                              <li>Configure the Machine Lockout Threshold setting to a sufficiently
                                 high value to provide users with the ability to accidentally
                                 mistype their password several times before the machine is locked,
                                 but ensure that a brute force password attack will still lock the
                                 account. A good recommendation for such a configuration is 50
                                 invalid logon attempts, which will prevent accidental account
                                 lockouts and reduce the number of help desk calls. This option is
                                 recommended if your organization does not have complex password
                                 requirements and an audit policy that alerts administrators to a

                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.

                              authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing
                              provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each
                              SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server.
                              <br/>Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance,
                              because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings
                              are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a
                              small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file
                              server, print server, and application server performance may be
                              substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to
                              ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and
                              operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you
                              completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to
                              session hijacking attacks.<br/>When SMB signing policies are enabled
                              on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers

                              applications also rely on the presence of short names, because short

                        computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include
                        transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network
                        administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is
                        the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is
                        not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or
                        NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2
                        (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all
                        Windows clients when they perform the following operations:</p>

                     <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Windows Vista, this setting is
                        undefined. However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP
                        clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication
                        responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The
                        default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers
                        and use their resources. However, this means that LM responses#x2014;the
                        weakest form of authentication response#x2014;are sent over the network, and
                        it is potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more
                        easily reproduce the user's password.<br/>The Windows 95, Windows 98, and
                        Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for
                        authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these
                        computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for
                        network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication
                        protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the
                        logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication
                        process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers,
                        Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use
                        the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server
                        2003 domain controllers.</p>

                        introduce an extension to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll.
                        In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decides whether to use Kerberos
                        or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts, which
                        is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs
                        including PKU2U. You can also develop or add other SSPs.<br/>When computers
                        are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
                        Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The
                        PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the
                        peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within
                        the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the
                        user's certificate to a security token and the logon process
                        completes.<br/>This policy will be turned off by default on domain joined
                        machines. This would disallow the online identities to be able to
                        authenticate to the domain joined machine in Windows 7. The recommended

                        to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets

                        from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement
                        strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure.
                        Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely

                        Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that
                        of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or
                        administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these
                        programs was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator"
                        because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To
                        address this risk, in Windows Vista the built-in Administrator account is
                        disabled. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with
                        administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two
                        ways:<br/>- If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user
                        account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local
                        administrator.<br/>- If the computer is joined to a domain, no local
                        administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator
                        must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account
                        is warranted. <br/>Once Windows Vista is installed, the built-in
                        Administrator account may be enabled, but we strongly recommend that this
                        account remain disabled.</p>

                        introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate is that of malicious
                        software running under elevated credentials without the user or
                        administrator being aware of its activity. This setting allows the

                        connected via Remote Assistance. This increases security in that
                        organizations can use UAC even when end user support is provided remotely.
                        However, it also reduces security by adding the risk that an administrator
                        might allow an unprivileged user to share elevated privileges for an
                        application that the adminstrator needs to use during the Remote Desktop

                           assigned to the Users group. If you have installed optional components
                           such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need to

                           components. It is important to verify that authorized users are assigned

               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users can create
                  symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files
                  and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object
                  called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk
                  file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or
                  another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is
                  that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and
                  applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the
                  concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.
                  Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications
                  that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating
                  symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only
                  Administrators can create symbolic links. When configuring a user right in the SCM
                  enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located

                        However, typical circumstances rarely require this capability on production

                        the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource
                        Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate
                        processes that they did not start. Also, some older versions of Update.exe
                        (which is used to install Windows product updates) require the account that
                        applies the update to have this user right. If you install one of the
                        patches that uses this version of Update.exe, the computer could become
                        unresponsive. For more information, see article 830846, Windows Product

                     computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log
                     entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are
                     created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain
                     may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the
                     domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires
                     that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                     administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                     may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.</p>

                     mitigated on most domain controllers, member servers, and end-user computers
                     because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with domain
                     controllers in the following ways:</p>
                  <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                     <li>All client desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating
                        domain controller as their inbound time partner.</li>
                     <li>All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller
                        (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.</li>
                     <li>All PDC emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the
                        selection of their inbound time partner.</li>
                     <li>The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is
                        authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you
                        configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time
                        server.</li>

                     connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. In Windows Vista, the
                     default behavior is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that
                     block the connection. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow

                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all
                     outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or
                     administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound
                     connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog
                     boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web
                     browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic
                     has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can
                     reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>

                  <description xml:lang="en">This setting determines the behavior for outbound
                     connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The default behavior
                     is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that block the
                     connection. Important If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy
                     the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings
                     cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an
                     outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                     Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that
                     these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before
                     deploying. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow
                        (default)</span>.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all
                     outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or
                     administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound
                     connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog
                     boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web
                     browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic
                     has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can
                     reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>

                  <description xml:lang="en">This setting determines the behavior for outbound
                     connections that do not match an outbound firewall rule. The default behavior
                     is to allow connections unless there are firewall rules that block the
                     connection. Important If you set Outbound connections to Block and then deploy
                     the firewall policy by using a GPO, computers that receive the GPO settings
                     cannot receive subsequent Group Policy updates unless you create and deploy an
                     outbound rule that enables Group Policy to work. Predefined rules for Core
                     Networking include outbound rules that enable Group Policy to work. Ensure that
                     these outbound rules are active, and thoroughly test firewall profiles before
                     deploying. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Allow

                  <rationale xml:lang="en">Some people believe that it is prudent to block all
                     outbound connections except those specifically approved by the user or
                     administrator. Microsoft disagrees with this opinion, blocking outbound
                     connections by default will force users to deal with a large number of dialog
                     boxes prompting them to authorize or block applications such as their web
                     browser or instant messaging software. Additionally, blocking outbound traffic
                     has little value because if an attacker has compromised the system they can
                     reconfigure the firewall anyway.</rationale>

                  an Ethernet network, network traffic is routed through the faster Ethernet

                     the list of programs that Windows Vista runs automatically when it starts, to

                     list setting in that programs on this list will run once the next time the
                     client computer restarts and an administrator logs on. Setup and installation
                     programs are sometimes added to this list to complete installations after a
                     client computer restarts. If you enable this policy setting, attackers
                     generally cannot use the run once list to launch rogue applications, which was
                     a common method of attack in the past. A malicious user can exploit the run
                     once list to install a program that may compromise the security of Windows
                     Vistabased client computers, however since editing this list requires
                     administrator privileges the importance of configuring this setting is not
                     high. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with security and
                     operational requirements of your organization.</description>

                     someone for help. Also, users can use instant messaging programs to allow

                     setting, you have two ways to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance:

                     file transfer can remain open. The "Select the method for sending email
                     invitations" setting specifies which email standard to use to send Remote

                     Mailto standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet link) or
                     the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to your email

               <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime
                  handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers. This policy setting
                  impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should
                  be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including
                  group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can
                  require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should
                  never be applied to a domain controller. If you disable this policy setting, the
                  RPC server runtime uses the value of "Authenticated" on Windows Client, and the
                  value of "None" on Windows Server versions that support this policy setting. If
                  you do not configure this policy setting, it remains disabled. The RPC server
                  runtime will behave as though it was enabled with the value of "Authenticated"
                  used for Windows Client and the value of "None" used for Server SKUs that support
                  this policy setting. If you enable this policy setting, it directs the RPC server
                  runtime to restrict unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers running
                  on a machine. A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a
                  named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC
                  Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated
                  clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for
                  this policy setting. -- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers
                  running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. -- "Authenticated"
                  allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC
                  Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions
                  are granted to interfaces that have requested them. -- "Authenticated without
                  exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to
                  connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is
                  applied. No exceptions are allowed. Note: This policy setting will not be applied
                  until the system is rebooted. The recommended state for this setting is: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="inline_block">Enabled:Authenticated</span>.</description>

                           hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
                           performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                           of data to the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                           options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used
                           instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support
                           hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                           algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                           hardware-based encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.<br/>
                           <br/>If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use

                           drive. If hardware-based encryption is not available BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used instead.<br/>

                           encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardware-based encryption is
                           set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                           algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The

                           hardware-based encryption#x201D; option enables you to restrict the
                           encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If
                           the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable
                           the use of hardware-based encryption.<br/>Encryption algorithms are
                           specified by object identifiers (OID). For example:<br/>- AES 128 in CBC

                           control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the
                           absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when
                           you turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether
                           a data recovery agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data
                           drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used it must be added from
                           the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management
                           Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive

                           whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a
                           48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.<br/>
                           <br/>Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to
                           prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker
                           on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                           recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                           recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.<br/>

                           in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive

                           stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box if you want to prevent
                           users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the
                           domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box is selected, a recovery
                           password is automatically generated.<br/>

                           recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA
                           is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including
                           the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information is not

                           hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
                           performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                           of data to the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                           options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used
                           instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support
                           hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                           algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                           hardware-based encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.<br/>
                           <br/>If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use

                           set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                           algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The

                           hardware-based encryption#x201D; option enables you to restrict the
                           encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If
                           the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable
                           the use of hardware-based encryption.<br/>Encryption algorithms are

                           constraints for passwords used to unlock BitLocker-protected operating
                           system drives. If non-TPM protectors are allowed on operating system
                           drives, you can provision a password, enforce complexity requirements on
                           the password, and configure a minimum length for the password. For the
                           complexity requirement setting to be effective the Group Policy setting
                           "Password must meet complexity requirements" located in Computer
                           Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
                           Policies\Password Policy\ must be also enabled.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: These settings are enforced when turning on BitLocker, not
                           when unlocking a volume. BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any
                           of the protectors available on the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, users can configure a password
                           that meets the requirements you define. To enforce complexity
                           requirements on the password, select "Require complexity".<br/>
                           <br/>When set to "Require complexity" a connection to a domain controller
                           is necessary when BitLocker is enabled to validate the complexity the
                           password. When set to "Allow complexity" a connection to a domain
                           controller will be attempted to validate the complexity adheres to the
                           rules set by the policy, but if no domain controllers are found the
                           password will still be accepted regardless of actual password complexity
                           and the drive will be encrypted using that password as a protector. When
                           set to "Do not allow complexity", no password complexity validation will
                           be done.<br/>
                           <br/>Passwords must be at least 8 characters. To configure a greater
                           minimum length for the password, enter the desired number of characters
                           in the "Minimum password length" box.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the default
                           length constraint of 8 characters will apply to operating system drive
                           passwords and no complexity checks will occur.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: Passwords cannot be used if FIPS-compliance is enabled. The
                           "System cryptography: Use FIPS-compliant algorithms for encryption,
                           hashing, and signing" policy setting in Computer Configuration\Windows
                           Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options specifies
                           whether FIPS-compliance is enabled. The recommended state for this
                           setting is: <span class="inline_block">Disabled</span>.</p>

                           is applied when you turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used
                           to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with
                           BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent
                           can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either
                           the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.
                           Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting allows you to
                           manage BitLocker#x2019;s use of hardware-based encryption on operating
                           system drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with
                           hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
                           performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                           of data to the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                           options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used
                           instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support
                           hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                           algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                           hardware-based encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.<br/>
                           <br/>If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use
                           hardware-based encryption with the encryption algorithm set for the
                           drive. If hardware-based encryption is not available BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used instead.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: The #x201C;Choose drive encryption method and cipher
                           strength#x201D; policy setting does not apply to hardware-based
                           encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardware-based encryption is
                           set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                           algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The
                           #x201C;Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed for
                           hardware-based encryption#x201D; option enables you to restrict the
                           encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If
                           the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable
                           the use of hardware-based encryption.<br/>Encryption algorithms are
                           specified by object identifiers (OID). For example:<br/>- AES 128 in CBC
                           mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2<br/>- AES 256 in CBC mode OID:

                           is applied when you turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used
                           to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with
                           BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent
                           can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either
                           the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.
                           Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft

                           recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                           recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain

                           stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a

                           the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box is selected, a
                           recovery password is automatically generated.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can control the methods

                           <br/>Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to
                           prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker
                           on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                           recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                           recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain

                           the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box is selected, a
                           recovery password is automatically generated.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can control the methods
                           available to users to recover data from BitLocker-protected operating
                           system drives.<br/>

                           recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA
                           is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including
                           the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information is not
                           backed up to AD DS. The recommended state for this setting is: <span class="inline_block">Enabled</span>.</p>

                           control how BitLocker-protected operating system drives are recovered in
                           the absence of the required startup key information. This policy setting
                           is applied when you turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used
                           to specify whether a data recovery agent can be used with
                           BitLocker-protected operating system drives. Before a data recovery agent
                           can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either
                           the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.
                           Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft
                           TechNet for more information about adding data recovery agents.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select
                           whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a
                           48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.<br/>
                           <br/>Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to
                           prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker
                           on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                           recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                           recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain

                           stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports recovering data from a

                           stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box if you want to
                           prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to
                           the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for operating system drives" check box is selected, a
                           recovery password is automatically generated.<br/>

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting allows you to
                           configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time
                           the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a
                           Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you
                           turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be
                           required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.<br/>
                           <br/>If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the
                           "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode a USB
                           drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt
                           the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB
                           key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is
                           accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use
                           one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication
                           methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted
                           data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for
                           authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive
                           containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal
                           identification number (PIN), or both.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced
                           startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can
                           configure only basic options on computers with a TPM.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB
                           flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line
                           tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting allows you to
                           configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time
                           the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a
                           Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you
                           turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be
                           required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.<br/>
                           <br/>If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the
                           "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode a USB
                           drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt
                           the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB
                           key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is
                           accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use
                           one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication
                           methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted
                           data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for
                           authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive
                           containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal
                           identification number (PIN), or both.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, users can configure advanced
                           startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can
                           configure only basic options on computers with a TPM.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB
                           flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line
                           tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.
                           The recommended state for this setting is: <span class="inline_block">Require startup PIN with TPM</span>.</p>

                           unlocking access to the BitLocker-encrypted operating system drive. If
                           any of these components change while BitLocker protection is in effect,
                           the TPM will not release the encryption key to unlock the drive and the
                           computer will instead display the BitLocker Recovery console and require
                           that either the recovery password or recovery key be provided to unlock
                           the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker
                           uses the default platform validation profile or the platform validation
                           profile specified by the setup script. A platform validation profile
                           consists of a set of Platform Configuration Register (PCR) indices
                           ranging from 0 to 23. The default platform validation profile secures the
                           encryption key against changes to the core system firmware executable
                           code (PCR 0), extended or pluggable executable code (PCR 2), boot manager
                           (PCR 4), and the BitLocker access control (PCR 11).<br/>
                           <br/>Warning: Changing from the default platform validation profile
                           affects the security and manageability of your computer. BitLocker's
                           sensitivity to platform modifications (malicious or authorized) is
                           increased or decreased depending upon inclusion or exclusion
                           (respectively) of the PCRs. Specifically, setting this policy with PCR 7
                           omitted, will override the "Allow Secured Boot for integrity validation"
                           group policy, preventing BitLocker from using Secured Boot for platform
                           or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation. Configure this
                           setting in a manner that is consistent with security and operational
                           requirements of your organization.</p>

                           control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in
                           the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied
                           when you turn on BitLocker.<br/>
                           <br/>The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether
                           a data recovery agent can be used with BitLocker-protected removable data
                           drives. Before a data recovery agent can be used it must be added from
                           the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management
                           Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive
                           Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information
                           about adding data recovery agents.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select
                           whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a
                           48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.<br/>
                           <br/>Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to
                           prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker
                           on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which
                           recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker
                           recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.<br/>
                           <br/>In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain
                           Services" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS
                           for removable data drives. If you select "Backup recovery password and
                           key package", both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are
                           stored in AD DS. If you select "Backup recovery password only" only the
                           recovery password is stored in AD DS.<br/>
                           <br/>Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for removable data drives" check box if you want to
                           prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to
                           the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.<br/>
                           <br/>Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is
                           stored in AD DS for fixed data drives" check box is selected, a recovery
                           password is automatically generated.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can control the methods
                           available to users to recover data from BitLocker-protected removable
                           data drives.<br/>
                           <br/>If this policy setting is not configured or disabled, the default
                           recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery. By default a DRA
                           is allowed, the recovery options can be specified by the user including
                           the recovery password and recovery key, and recovery information is not
                           backed up to AD DS. The recommended state for this setting is: <span class="inline_block">Do not allow 48-digit recovery

                           hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
                           performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing
                           of data to the drive.<br/>
                           <br/>If you enable this policy setting, you can specify additional
                           options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used
                           instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support
                           hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
                           algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.<br/>
                           <br/>If you disable this policy setting, BitLocker cannot use
                           hardware-based encryption with operating system drives and BitLocker
                           software-based encryption will be used by default when the drive is encrypted.<br/>
                           <br/>If you do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will use
                           hardware-based encryption with the encryption algorithm set for the
                           drive. If hardware-based encryption is not available BitLocker

                           encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardware-based encryption is
                           set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the
                           algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The

                        configure the algorithm and cipher strength used by BitLocker Drive
                        Encryption. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.
                        Changing the encryption method has no effect if the drive is already
                        encrypted or if encryption is in progress. Consult the BitLocker Drive
                        Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about
                        the encryption methods available. This policy is only applicable to
                        computers running Windows 8 Consumer Preview and later.<br/>
                        <br/> If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose an
                        encryption algorithm and key cipher strength for BitLocker to use to encrypt drives.<br/>
                        <br/> If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, BitLocker will
                        use AES with the same bit strength (128-bit or 256-bit) as the "Choose drive

                        Windows 7)" policy setting, if it is set. If neither policy is set,
                        BitLocker will use the default encryption method of AES 128-bit or the
                        encryption method specified by the setup script. The recommended state for
                        this setting is: <span class="inline_block">Enabled:AES 256-bit</span>.</p>

                           <p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information
                              unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed.<br/>The
                              consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed
                              from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration,
                              because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to
                              overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat
                              reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
                              <br/>Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a
                              server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other
                              automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly
                              important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server
                              could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
                              server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the
                              attacker's activities.</p>

                           <p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information

                              overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate
                              the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
                              method so that older events are overwritten as needed.<br/>The
                              consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed
                              from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration,
                              because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to
                              overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat
                              reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.
                              <br/>Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a
                              server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other
                              automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly
                              important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server
                              could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring

                  <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting allows you to specify an intranet
                     server to host updates from the Microsoft Update Web site. You can then use
                     this update service location to automatically update computers on your network.
                     The Automatic Updates client will search this service for updates that apply to
                     the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, you must set two server name values: the server from
                     which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the
                     server to which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values
                     to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the
                     specified intranet Microsoft update service server (instead of Windows Update)
                     to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your
                     organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to
                     test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not configure this
                     policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the
                     Windows Update site on the Internet (if Automatic Updates is not disabled by
                     Group Policy or user preference). Configure this setting in a manner that is
                     consistent with security and operational requirements of your
                     organization.</description>
                  <rationale xml:lang="en">By default, Automatic Updates will attempt to download
                     updates from the Microsoft Windows Update Web site. Some organizations want to
                     verify that all new updates are compatible with their particular environment
                     before they are deployed. Also, if you configure an internal Software Update
                     Services (SUS) server you will help reduce the load on perimeter firewalls,
                     routers, and proxy servers, as well as the load on external network
                     links.</rationale>
