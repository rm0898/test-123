   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

                        synchronization'</title>
                     <description xml:lang="en">Many security services, especially authentication,
                        rely on an accurate computer clock to perform their jobs. You should ensure
                        computer time is accurate and that all servers in your organization use the
                        same time source. The Windows Server 2003 W32Time service provides time
                        synchronization for Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows XPbased
                        computers that run in an Active Directory domain. The W32Time service
                        synchronizes the clocks of Windows Server 2003based computers with the
                        domain controllers in a domain. This synchronization is necessary for the
                        Kerberos protocol and other authentication protocols to work properly. To
                        function correctly, a number of Windows Server family components rely on
                        accurate and synchronized time. If the clocks are not synchronized on the
                        clients, the Kerberos authentication protocol might deny access to users.
                        Another important benefit that time synchronization provides is event
                        correlation on all of the clients in your enterprise. Synchronized clocks on
                        the clients in your environment ensure that you can correctly analyze events
                        that take place in uniform sequence on those clients throughout the
                        organization. The W32Time service uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to
                        synchronize clocks on computers that run Windows Server 2003. In a Windows
                        Server 2003 forest, time is synchronized by default in the following manner:
                        . The primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master in the
                        forest root domain is the authoritative time source for the organization. .
                        All PDC operation masters in other domains in the forest follow the
                        hierarchy of domains when they select a PDC emulator with which to
                        synchronize their time. . All domain controllers in a domain synchronize
                        their time with the PDC emulator operations master in their domain as their
                        inbound time partner. . All member servers and client desktop computers use
                        the authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. To
                        ensure that the time is accurate, the PDC emulator in the forest root domain
                        can be synchronized to an authoritative time source, such as a reliable NTP
                        source or a highly accurate clock on your network. Note that NTP
                        synchronization uses UDP port 123 traffic. Before you synchronize with an
                        external server, you should weigh the benefits of opening this port against
                        the potential security risk. Also, if you synchronize with an external
                        server that you do not control, you risk configuring your servers with the
                        incorrect time. The external server could be compromised or spoofed by an
                        attacker to maliciously manipulate the clocks on your computers. As
                        explained earlier, the Kerberos authentication protocol requires
                        synchronized computer clocks. If they are not synchronized, a denial of
                        service may occur.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">To prevent "replay attacks," the Kerberos
                        authentication protocol uses time stamps as part of its protocol definition.
                        For time stamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the domain
                        controller need to be closely synchronized. Because the clocks of two
                        computers are often not synchronized, administrators can use this policy to
                        establish the maximum acceptable difference to Kerberos between a client
                        clock and a domain controller clock. If the difference between the client
                        clock and the domain controller clock is less than the maximum time
                        difference specified in this setting, any time stamp that is used in a
                        session between the two computers is considered to be authentic.</rationale>

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines the period of time
                        (in days) during which a user's ticket-granting ticket (TGT) can be renewed.
                        To prevent replay attacks, the Kerberos authentication protocol uses time
                        stamps as part of its protocol definition. For time stamps to work properly,
                        the clocks of the client and the domain controller need to be synchronized
                        as closely as possible. Because the clocks of two computers are often not
                        synchronized, administrators can use this policy to establish the maximum
                        elapsed time within which a Kerberos negotiation must complete; the elapsed
                        time is computed from the timestamps. The value of this setting limits the
                        maximum time difference that can be tolerated between the domain controller
                        and the client computer.</description>

                           can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
                           remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer

                           accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold

                           characters.</p>
                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">#x2022; A robust auditing mechanism,
                           which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs
                           in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for
                           security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that
                           there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt.</p>

                           brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent
                           accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                           prevent a DoS attack.</p>

                           may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The

                           it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic
                           password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character
                           case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627
                           combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible
                           combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000
                           attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible
                           passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for
                           passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters
                           such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it

                                 the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For
                                 example, a custom password filter might require the use of
                                 non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that
                                 require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits
                                 between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a
                                 dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not
                                 contain common dictionary words or fragments.</p>
                              <p>Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance
                                 the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password
                                 requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help
                                 desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement
                                 for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the
                                 0128#x00E2;#x20AC;#x201C;0159 range. (ALT characters outside of

                                 would not add additional complexity to the password.)</p>

                           There are many different theories about how to determine the best
                           password length for an organization, but perhaps "pass phrase" is a
                           better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass
                           phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase
                           such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid pass phrase; it is a
                           considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
                           numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be
                           educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords,

                                 passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account
                                 lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your

                        challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for
                        local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in
                        Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to
                        protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is
                        that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues,
                        which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks thattempt to guess
                        passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and
                        there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID
                        rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename
                        the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by
                        using the SID to log on.</rationale>

                     <description xml:lang="en">LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft
                        client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together
                        on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print
                        sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active
                        Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication
                        protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some
                        reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager
                        authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants,
                        and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when
                        they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate
                        between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains .
                        Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
                        or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
                        possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level
                        setting are: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses . Send LM &amp; NTLM — use
                        NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send
                        NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2
                        responses only\refuse LM &amp; NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN
                        Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response
                        authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the
                        authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level
                        that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers
                        accept as follows: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
                        authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM &amp; NTLM use NTLMv2
                        session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and
                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only.
                        Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2

                        Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3
                        Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2
                        session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM,
                        NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM

                        if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that
                        is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However,
                        in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured
                        by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based
                        and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers
                        allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
                        However, this means that LM responses—the weakest form of authentication
                        response—are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
                        attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's
                        password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems
                        cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this
                        reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by
                        default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You
                        can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows
                        98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
                        secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2
                        for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
                        members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
                        authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</rationale>

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines which users or groups
                        might access DCOM application remotely or locally. This setting is used to
                        control the attack surface of the computer for DCOM applications. You can
                        use this policy setting to specify access permissions to all the computers
                        to particular users for DCOM applications in the enterprise. When you
                        specify the users or groups that are to be given permission, the security
                        descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition
                        Language representation of those groups and privileges. If the security
                        descriptor is left blank, the policy setting is defined in the template, but
                        it is not enforced. Users and groups can be given explicit Allow or Deny
                        privileges on both local access and remote access. The registry settings
                        that are created as a result of enabling the DCOM: Machine Access
                        Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax policy
                        setting take precedence over (have higher priority) the previous registry
                        settings in this area. RpcSs checks the new registry keys in the Policies
                        section for the computer restrictions, and these registry entries take
                        precedence over the existing registry keys under OLE. This means that
                        previously existing registry settings are no longer effective, and if you
                        make changes to the existing settings, the computer access permissions for
                        any users are not changed. You should take care to correctly configure their
                        list of users and groups. The possible values for this policy setting are:
                        Blank. This represents the local security policy way of deleting the policy
                        enforcement key. This value deletes the policy and then sets it as Not
                        defined state. The Blank value is set by using the ACL editor and emptying
                        the list, and then pressing OK. SDDL. This is the Security Descriptor
                        Definition Language representation of the groups and privileges you specify
                        when you enable this policy. Not Defined. This is the default value. Note If
                        the administrator is denied permission to access DCOM applications due to
                        the changes made to DCOM in SP2, the administrator can use the DCOM: Machine
                        Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) syntax
                        policy setting to manage DCOM access to the computer. The administrator can
                        specify which users and groups can access the DCOM application on the
                        computer both locally and remotely by using this setting. This will restore
                        control of the DCOM application to the administrator and users. To do this,
                        open the DCOM: Machine Access Restrictions in Security Descriptor Definition
                        Language (SDDL) syntax setting, and click Edit Security. Specify the groups
                        you want to include and the computer access permissions for those groups.
                        This defines the setting and sets the appropriate SDDL value.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Many COM applications include some security-specific
                        code (for example, to call CoInitializeSecurity) but use weak settings that
                        often allow unauthenticated access to the process. Administrators cannot
                        override these settings to force stronger security in earlier versions of
                        Windows without modifying the application. An attacker could attempt to
                        exploit weak security in an individual application by attacking it through
                        COM calls. Also, COM infrastructure includes the Remote Procedure Call
                        System Service (RPCSS), a system service that runs during computer startup
                        and always runs after that. This service manages activation of COM objects
                        and the running object table, and provides helper services to DCOM remoting.
                        It exposes RPC interfaces that can be called remotely. Because some COM
                        servers allow unauthenticated remote access, these interfaces can be called
                        by anyone, including unauthenticated users. As a result, RPCSS can be
                        attacked by malicious users who use remote, unauthenticated
                        computers.</rationale>

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who
                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then forward themso that the server might
                        perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the
                        server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized
                        access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by
                        the Windows operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and
                        the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication
                        process, data transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who
                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows

                              where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials
                              as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT

                              operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
                              channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless

                              The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients
                              running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will

                        and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol
                        that is supported by many Windows operating systems.SMB signatures
                        authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side
                        fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take
                        place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                        validates the account. Authentication of a domain user account on a domain
                        controller generates an account logon event that is logged in the domain
                        controller's Security log. Authentication of a local user on a local
                        computer generates a logon event that is logged in the local Security log.
                        No account logoff events are logged. The following table includes the
                        important security events that this policy setting logs in the Security log.
                        These event IDs can be useful when you want to create custom alerts to
                        monitor any software suite, such as Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM).

                        Windows Server 2003 with SP1, the type of this event will be Success Audit
                        for successful requests or Failure Audit for failed requests. 673 A ticket
                        granting service (TGS) ticket was granted. A TGS is a ticket that is issued
                        by the Kerberos version 5 TGS that allows a user to authenticate to a
                        specific service in the domain. Windows Server 2003 with SP1 will log
                        successes and failures for this event type. 674 A security principal renewed
                        an AS ticket or a TGS ticket. 675 Pre-authentication failed. This event is
                        generated on a Key Distribution Center (KDC) when a user enters an incorrect
                        password. 676 Authentication ticket request failed. This event is not
                        generated by Windows Server 2003 with SP1. Other Windows versions use this
                        event to indicate an authentication failure that was not due to incorrect
                        credentials. 677 A TGS ticket was not granted. This event is not generated
                        by Windows Server 2003 with SP1, which uses a failure audit event with ID
                        672 for this case. 678 An account was successfully mapped to a domain
                        account. 681 Logon failure. A domain account logon was attempted. This event
                        is only generated by domain controllers. 682 A user has reconnected to a
                        disconnected Terminal Server session. 683 A user disconnected a Terminal
                        Server session but did not log off.</description>

                     <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting determines whether to audit each
                        account management event on a computer. Examples of account management
                        events include: . A user account or group is created, changed, or deleted. .
                        A user account is renamed, disabled, or enabled. . A password is set or
                        changed. Organizations need to be able to determine who creates, modifies,
                        or deletes both domain and local accounts. Unauthorized changes could
                        indicate mistaken changes made by an administrator who does not understand
                        how to follow organizational policies, but could also indicate a deliberate
                        attack. The following table includes the important security events that this
                        policy setting records in the Security log. These event IDs can be useful
                        when you want to create custom alerts to monitor any software suite, such as
                        MOM. Most operational management software can be customized with scripts to
                        capture or flag events that are based on these event IDs. Table 4.4 Account

                        which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system
                        components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need
                        to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new
                        system components will need it. Note Microsoft released several security
                        updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the
                        administrator to have the Debug programs user right. Administrators who did
                        not have this user right were unable to install these security updates until
                        they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical behavior for
                        operating system updates. For more information, see Knowledge Base article

                        assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this

                        Administrators group is diminished by the fact that a malicious user who has
                        administrative privileges can bypass the countermeasure by launching

                              Also, some older versions of Update.exe (which is used to install
                              Windows product updates) require the account that applies the update
                              to have this user right. If you install one of the patches that uses

                           users can add computer workstations to a specific domain. For this policy
                           setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the
                           Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been
                           assigned this right can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users
                           who have been assigned the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU
                           or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited
                           number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have been
                           assigned the Add workstations to a domain user right.<br/>By default, all
                           users in the Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10
                           computer accounts to an Active Directory domain. These new computer
                           accounts are created in the Computers container.<br/>In Windowsbased
                           networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or
                           computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control
                           access to resources. In an Active Directory domain, each computer account
                           is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access
                           domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the
                           number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
                           consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed
                           to add computers to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be
                           hampered. Also, users could perform activities that are more difficult to
                           trace because of their ability to create additional unauthorized domain computers.<br/>

                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                        behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so
                        that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for
                        this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to
                        convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or
                        named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client,
                        which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or
                        system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have
                        the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM
                        servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run
                        under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access
                        tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they
                        are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the
                        following conditions exist: . The access token that is being impersonated is
                        for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network
                        with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level
                        is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with
                        the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a
                        service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then
                        impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of
                        the client. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited
                        list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active
                        Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers.</description>

                        bypass traverse checking. Permissions to files and folders are controlled
                        though appropriate configuration of file system access control lists (ACLs),
                        as the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any read or write
                        permissions to the user. The only scenario in which the default

                        configures permissions does not understand how this policy setting works.
                        For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to
                        access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders.
                        Such a situation is unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents
                        little risk.</rationale>

                           that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this
                           configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.
                           Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can
                           generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of
                           their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the
                           archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
                           monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
                           Operations Manager (MOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a

                           successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all
                           events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather
                           forensic information about the attacker's activities.</p>

                                 ICMP message types. As a result, utilities that rely on ICMP may
                                 fail. Some applications require some ICMP messages in order to
                                 function properly. Also, ICMP messages are used to estimate network

                           to open a port and are not allowed to do so because of current Windows
                           Firewall rules. The Windows Firewall: Prohibit notifications setting
                           determines whether these settings are shown to the users. If you
                           configure this policy setting to Enabled, Windows Firewall prevents the
                           display of these notifications. If you configure it to Disabled, Windows
                           Firewall allows the display of these notifications.</description>

                           allows. Utilities can use ICMP messages to determine the status of other
                           computers. For example, Ping uses the echo request message. If you
                           configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Enabled,
                           you must specify which ICMP message types Windows Firewall allows the
                           computer to send or receive. When you configure this policy setting to
                           Disabled, Windows Firewall blocks all unsolicited inbound ICMP message
                           types and the listed outbound ICMP message types. As a result, utilities
                           that rely on ICMP may fail. Many attacker tools take advantage of
                           computers that accept ICMP message types and use these messages to mount
                           a variety of attacks. However, some applications require some ICMP
                           messages in order to function properly. Also, ICMP messages are used to
                           estimate network performance when Group Policy is downloaded and
                           processed; if ICMP messages are blocked, Group Policy may not be applied
                           to affected systems. For that reason, it is recommended that you
                           configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Disabled
                           whenever possible. If your environment requires some ICMP messages to get

                           appropriate message types. Whenever the computer is on an untrusted
                           network, the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting should be
                           configured to Disabled. Note If any policy setting opens TCP port 445,
                           Windows Firewall allows inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those

                              <p>If you configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions
                                 setting to Enabled, you must specify which ICMP message types
                                 Windows Firewall allows the computer to send or receive. When you
                                 configure this policy setting to Disabled, Windows Firewall blocks
                                 all unsolicited inbound ICMP message types and the listed outbound
                                 ICMP message types. As a result, utilities that rely on ICMP may
                                 fail. Some applications require some ICMP messages in order to
                                 function properly. Also, ICMP messages are used to estimate network
                                 performance when Group Policy is downloaded and processed; if ICMP
                                 messages are blocked, Group Policy may not be applied to affected
                                 systems. Note If any policy setting opens TCP port 445, Windows
                                 Firewall allows inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those
                                 sent by the Ping utility), even if the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP
                                 exceptions policy setting would block them. Policy settings that
                                 can open TCP port 445 include Windows Firewall: Allow inbound file

                     this update service location to automatically update computers on your network.
                     The Automatic Updates client will search this service for updates that apply to
                     the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, you must set two server name values: the server from
                     which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the
                     server to which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values
                     to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the
                     specified intranet Microsoft update service server (instead of Windows Update)
                     to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your
                     organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to
                     test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not configure this
                     policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the
                     Windows Update site on the Internet (if Automatic Updates is not disabled by

                        Error Reporting features of Windows XP and Office will send data to
                        Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep confidential. The
                        Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting ensures
                        that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows
                        Corporate Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure
                        this feature so that no information is transmitted outside of the
                        organization without first being reviewed by a trusted member of the IT
                        team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is more
                        difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations
                        that develop their own internal business applications can also take
                        advantage of Windows Corporate Error Reporting to track down problems within
                        their code. A reasonable configuration that ensures privacy and uses Windows
                        Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your own internal
                        Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to
                        point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An
                        administrator can then review the reports on the CER server and generate an
                        aggregate report for Microsoft that contains no confidential
                        information.</rationale>

                     when it installs any program on the system. This setting extends elevated
                     privileges to all programs. These privileges are usually reserved for programs
                     that have been assigned to the user (offered on the desktop), assigned to the
                     computer (installed automatically), or made available in Add or Remove Programs
                     in Control Panel. This setting lets users install programs that require access
                     to directories that the user might not have permission to view or change,
                     including directories on highly restricted computers. If you disable this
                     setting or do not configure it, the system applies the current user's
                     permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator does not
                     distribute or offer. Note: This setting appears both in the Computer
                     Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this setting effective,
                     you must enable the setting in both folders. Caution: Skilled users can take
                     advantage of the permissions this setting grants to change their privileges and
                     gain permanent access to restricted files and folders. Note that the User
                     Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be
                     secure.</description>
