    <xhtml:p>This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Fedora 28 derived Linux distribution systems running on x86_64 platforms.</xhtml:p>
    <xhtml:p>The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user. Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results, or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>

  <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

        <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>
 directory, this data will still consume space in           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span>
 once the           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span>

          <xhtml:p>A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them, especially in light of frequent operating system changes.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Fedora 28 derived Linux distributions use dnf (previously yum) to install and update software packages. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a local updates server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a single deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to production.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
        <xhtml:p>Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the processes can be reduced.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:strong>Impact:</xhtml:strong>
 Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.        </xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:Group id="xccdf_org.cisecurity.benchmarks_group_1.7.1_Configure_SELinux">
        <xccdf:title xml:lang="en">Configure SELinux</xccdf:title>
        <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
          <xhtml:p>SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>In Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility.  The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>
This automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Two such policies have been designed for use with Fedora 28 Family Linux distributions and are included with the system:             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>
. These are described as follows:          </xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>
              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
: targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited. SELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
              <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mls</xhtml:span>
: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.            </xhtml:li>
          </xhtml:ul>
          <xhtml:p>
This section provides guidance for the configuration of the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">targeted</xhtml:span>
policy.          </xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
          </xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:li>Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist.</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.</xhtml:li>

Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.

Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system.

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the "               <xhtml:span class="inline_block">uname -a</xhtml:span>

The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number of possible threats to the resulting system.

When             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies</xhtml:span>
 is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.          </xhtml:p>

Because of this NetworkManager tells firewalld to assign the network interface that is used for this connection to the zone defined in the configuration of that connection. This assignment happens before the interface is used. The configuration of the connection can either be the NetworkManager configuration or also an ifcfg for example. If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the firewalld configuration. If a connection has more than one interface, all of them will be supplied to firewalld. Also changes in the names of interfaces will be handled by NetworkManager and supplied to firewalld.</xhtml:p>

        <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
          <xhtml:p>nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables.  The biggest change with the successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands.  With nftables, the simpler syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.  Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related nftables modules. Please ensure that your kernel supports nf_tables before choosing this option.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.</xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>The following will implement the firewall rules of this section and open ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening  the ports for ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) needs to be updated in accordence with local site policy. Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site policy.</xhtml:p>

          <xhtml:p>IPtables is an application that allows a system administrator to configure the IPv4 and IPv6 tables, chains and rules provided by the Linux kernel firewall. While several methods of configuration exist this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables rules are in place, not how they are configured.  If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similar settings should be applied to the IP6tables as well.</xhtml:p>

          <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. This needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect as per site policy.</xhtml:p>

          <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Ip6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>If IPv6 in enabled on the system, the ip6tables should be configured.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset (established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). Remediation steps included only affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. This needs to be updated to only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect as per site policy.</xhtml:p>

    <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
      <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
It is recommended that         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog</xhtml:span>
be used for logging (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch</xhtml:span>
providing summarization) and         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
 be used for auditing (with         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport</xhtml:span>
providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.      </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference &lt;        <xhtml:a href="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/</xhtml:a>
&gt; manual page for more information on configuring chrony.      </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong>
 There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (        <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>
). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640</xhtml:span>
where         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp</xhtml:span>
 is the defined security group (in some cases         <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>
).      </xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
        <xhtml:p>
System auditing, through           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>
, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>
. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit.        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:code class="code_block">awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
</xhtml:code>
        <xhtml:p>If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit&gt;=1000 with audit&gt;=&lt;UID_MIN for your system&gt; in the Audit and Remediation procedures.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong>
 Once all configuration changes have been made to           <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules</xhtml:span>
, the auditd configuration must be reloaded with the following command:        </xhtml:p>

          <xhtml:p>When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.</xhtml:p>

 ,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ftruncate</xhtml:span>
 ) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a non-privileged user (auid &gt; = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "access."          </xhtml:p>

It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 file systems to the system. While tracking             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">mount</xhtml:span>
 commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">open</xhtml:span>

 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">truncate</xhtml:span>
 system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.          </xhtml:p>

, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export.  Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.              </xhtml:p>

The two options             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 and             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 variable is set,             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">sshd</xhtml:span>
 will send client alive messages at every             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ssh</xhtml:span>
 session is terminated. For example, if the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveInterval</xhtml:span>
 is set to 15 seconds and the             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>

Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ssh</xhtml:span>
 session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..          </xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:p>
While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for             <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ClientAliveCountMax</xhtml:span>
 is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent.          </xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Authselect is a utility that simplifies the configuration of user authentication on a CentOS Linux host. Authselect offers two ready-made profiles that can be universally used with all modern identity management systems</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Authselect makes testing and troubleshooting easy because it only modifies files in these directories:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ul>
          <xhtml:li>

          <xhtml:strong>Notes:</xhtml:strong>
        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ul>
          <xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:strong>Do not use authselect if your host is part of CentOS Linux Identity Management or Active Directory</xhtml:strong>
. The ipa-client-install command, called when joining your host to a CentOS Identity Management domain, takes full care of configuring authentication on your host. Similarly the realm join command, called when joining your host to an Active Directory domain, takes full care of configuring authentication on your host.          </xhtml:li>
          <xhtml:li>You can create and deploy a custom profile by customizing one of the default profiles, the sssd, winbind, or the nis profile. This is particularly useful if Modifying a ready-made authselect profile is not enough for your needs. When you deploy a custom profile, the profile is applied to every user logging into the given host.  This would be the recommended method, so that the existing profiles can remain unmodified.</xhtml:li>

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems.

 directory. PAM must be carefully configured to secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.        </xhtml:p>
